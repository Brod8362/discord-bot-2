Info
====

This is a full rewrite of my other discord bot in JDA.

[Add to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=451526467596058625&scope=bot&permissions=0)

Setup
====
Put your token in the file named "token.default" and rename it to "token", with no extension.

If you'd like a custom prefix, make a file named "prefix" and put your desired prefix in it. Restart the bot for changes to take effect.

Bugs
====
Please report any bugs you find, and feel free to fix them with a pull request.
